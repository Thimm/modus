        UNKNOWN: I have no idea what this is.  Schema says often refers to LayerID.

        We do not have an Event-level ID that would group together reports.
        The reportid seems to be of the form <2-digit year><3-digit day number>-<sequence #>
        but that sequence number is for all the samples the lab ran that day, not just the ones
        that go with this "Event".  i.e. reportID = F211267-0039 on the top of our PDF
        was the 39th report generated on the 267th day of 2021 (Sep 24).
